# Websocket-Messenger
Websocket-Messenger is the backend api for an instant message type chat feature.

The messenger allows you to create a user, log in and out, view profiles, start new conversations, as well as create, edit, and delete messages to conversation partners.

This is a work in progress and the ReadMe will be updated as I go.
